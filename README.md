# grammar_fixer_python
Basic grammar fixer for Word files in Python
explanation of the code:
1.	We import the necessary libraries: docx for working with Word files and language_tool_python for grammar checking.
2.	The fix_grammar function takes a paragraph as input and performs the following steps:
•	It initializes LanguageTool with the 'en-US' language using language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US').
•	It checks the paragraph for grammar errors using tool.check(paragraph.text), which returns a list of matches.
•	It iterates over the matches in reverse order using reversed(matches) to avoid issues with modifying the paragraph while iterating.
•	For each match, it obtains the start and end positions of the error in the paragraph using match.offset and match.errorLength.
•	It obtains the first suggestion for correcting the error from match.replacements[0].
•	It replaces the error in the paragraph with the suggestion by modifying the paragraph's text accordingly.
•	Finally, it returns the corrected paragraph text.
3.	The fix_grammar_in_file function takes the input file path and the output file path as inputs and performs the following steps:
•	It loads the input Word file specified by input_file using docx.Document(input_file).
•	It creates a new Word document using new_doc = docx.Document().
•	It iterates over each paragraph in the input document using doc.paragraphs.
•	For each paragraph, it calls the fix_grammar function to fix the grammar and obtain the corrected text.
•	It adds the corrected text as a new paragraph in the new Word document using new_doc.add_paragraph(fixed_text).
•	Finally, it saves the new Word document to the output file specified by output_file using new_doc.save(output_file).
4.	In the example usage section, you need to replace 'path/to/your/input_file.docx' with the path to your input Word file and 'path/to/your/output_file.docx' with the desired path for the output Word file.
Overall, the code initializes LanguageTool, checks each paragraph for grammar errors, applies corrections to the errors, and saves the corrected text to a new Word file.
